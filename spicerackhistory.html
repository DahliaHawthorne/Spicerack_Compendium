        <h1>Animated Timeline</h1>
        <p>
           Welcome to Spicerack history! I've scoured most of the #oof server (since ~early 2020) and collected some of the most historical, most memorable, and events 
           needing documenting. So have fun reliving some of the highlights of Spicerack in this timeline!

                <h2>Michael Moves On</h2>
                <p>
            [5/02/20] Starting off with a sad one, Michael (a good pal of many in Spicerack)
            moved out of ESM, which is very unfortunate (I never even got to meet him). I wish him luck
            on his continuous travels, and he will always live on in Spicerack history

                <p>
                [2/23/20] Ya'll are really making me grasp at straws for content for the history section XD. 
                Anywho, Nick got a haircut this day and asked for everyone's opinion. Luckily I can't figure out how to get an image
                on the left side, so he's spared from further embarrassment.

                <h2>Nick Gets Exposed (Pt.1)</h2>
                <p>
            Part 1 of a 2 part series, Nick was exposed for being a, *gasp*, <I>K-Pop Stan?</I>
            Unfortunately I couldn't get the previous context for this, but it seems as this was 
            a larger revelation that I would think.

                <p>
                [7/21/20] I got added, wooo! What would ya'll do without me? It's funny to think I would never be friends with ya'll had it not been
                a Spartan Academy summer program, and even more specifically if I had never stayed after in the meeting. It's crazy to think that 
                one small decision like that has so many impacts.

                <p>
            [7/23/20] Part 2, Nick was minding his own afternoon when suddenly, he was exposed yet again. This time, he was exposed for being being bi,
            in a time where he refused to admit he wasn't straight. Now he's pan and much more acceptful of his identity, but it was fun to laugh at the evidence
            being straight in his face without him realizing it.

            [8/02/20] I still shudder at the thought of this night. I don't want to go into too much detail, but let's
            just say Nick and a yellow thong leads to a very, eventful night to say the least.

            [9/10/20] Spicerack goes virtual! The start of the junior year was met with dismay, as it was going to start as virtual, which no-one enjoys.
            Teachers who have no clue how to even open a window, supposedly rampant Trump flags (looking at you Kyler), and a heightened sense of
            anxiety. But hey, we survived, right?
