<center><h2 style="color: white">Hi friends.</h2></center>
<center><h2 style="color: white">So, this is the Spicerack Compendium, pretty neat, right? This was one of the reasons why I didn't do the Secret Santa thingie (although I'm sure a few of you are still upset about that lol)</h2></center>
<center><h2 style="color: white">I'll get to the point, I love ya'll, ya'll are some of the best friends I could ask for. You welcomed me with open arms last year and allowed me to become part of a group of just amazing people. And it was all because of a server, Spicerack. So, in commemeration, I wanted to make something to psuedo-document psuedo-celebrate the server. And what better way than a sort of virtual museam?</h2></center>
<center><h2 style="color: white">So, I hope you like it as much as I do, and make sure to message me if I forgot, misconstrued, or you want me to add something.</h2></center>
<center><h2 style="color: white">Love, Dahlia :)</h2></center>

<center><h2 style="color: white">P.S: Please note this is a work in progress, I still have a lot to add and fix!</h2></center>
